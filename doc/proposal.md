# Chemical Reaction Analysis

### -Intro-

This project will be the creation of a web application that can be used to predict products of reactions, as well as calculatingthe equations that are necessary for these reactions.The reactions will be broken down into their most basic fields of Ionic and Organic Chemistry for simplicity. The equations will be broken up into precent composition, theoretical yield and several othersas deemed necessary for accuracy and realistic necessity for labratory work.

### -Product Properties-

As stated, this project will be made up of 2 main properties, reactions and equations. The ionic reactions will include the basic display of the starting material (reactants), reaction conditions, finished product and by-products(products) and predict the product's and by-product's states of matter. The ionic reactions will include elemental and compound reactants to allow for increased complexity and versatility. The user interaction for the ionic reactions will include the implementation of buttons to allow for useage of the predetermined elements, as well as conditional requirments necessary for reaction completion. The organic reactions will use a similiar method of processing reactions but be limited in a size of several carbons due to complexity issues.

The equations will be from chosen from basic equations that are are considered "General Chemistry" from the American Chemical Society's authorization material. These equations will be on a seperate webpage from the reactions for simplicity and ease of access.

### -Implementation-

The product will be designed as a webpage. We will be using a database for all chemical knowledge necessary for the product's executable functions to work. All values will come from The American Chemical Society or other peer-reviewed articles as necessary.
